# Bioinf-tools

A collection of tools useful in everyday bioinformatics workflows.

So far, this is just a place to collect some of the scripts I wrote and
that may be useful for others.
Please be aware that method documentation, unit tests, etc. will be
added gradually.

Finally, if you find a bug or have a feature to add, please create an
[issue](https://github.com/JungeAlexander/bioinf-tools/issues) or submit a pull request.
